                            Guard Duty: Lifeguards vs. Patrons thrives on a
                            unique blend of social deduction, strategic
                            guarding, and hidden roles. Each game unfolds in a
                            tense cycle of Night, Results, and Day phases, where
                            players must read their opponents, bluff
                            convincingly, and coordinate or deceive to
                            outmaneuver the other team. For Lifeguards,
                            effective dynamics include coordinating guards
                            across multiple pools, sharing subtle information
                            during discussions, and protecting high-value roles
                            like Security or Supervisor. Patrons rely on
                            calculated sabotage, silence abilities, and roles
                            like Chameleon and Disruptor to sow confusion and
                            fracture the Lifeguards’ trust. Both teams navigate
                            evolving probabilities: sabotage success increases
                            with misdirected guards, while investigations become
                            more accurate as patterns emerge. Players face
                            constant trade-offs — pursue aggressive eliminations
                            or keep cover, protect one player or spread defense
                            — leading to shifting alliances and momentum swings.
                            Every round amplifies tension, rewarding clever
                            deduction, psychological strategy, and well-timed
                            role abilities over sheer luck. The interplay of
                            hidden identities and special powers ensures no two
                            games play the same, creating dynamic, replayable
                            sessions full of dramatic reveals and hard-fought
                            victories.
